# 📄 Homework 1 – Coding with AI  
## Case Study Report

This homework explores AI-assisted development across three problems: building a GitHub Pages blog, implementing a Pac-Man game, and constructing an automated arXiv feed.

For Problems 1 and 2, I primarily used AI-assisted code generation and iterative refinement through conversational tools and IDE suggestions.

For Problem 3, I explicitly used GitHub Copilot CLI to practice agentic programming, modular system design, and automation.

I used late day for 19 hours and I have 2 days and 7 hours remaining.

# 🔹 Problem 1 – GitHub Website for Coding Blog

## Objective

Create a minimal, expandable homepage hosted on GitHub Pages that includes:

- Header with site name  
- Navigation bar  
- Blog section  
- Link to Pac-Man game  
- Link to arXiv feed page  

---

## Development Process

For this problem, I used AI-assisted code generation to scaffold the HTML/CSS layout. I began by requesting a minimal modern layout and then refined spacing, typography, and modular structure.

### Initial Prompt Strategy

I asked for:

- A clean and expandable homepage layout  
- Semantic HTML structure  
- Separate CSS file  
- Modern but minimal styling  

The initial scaffold worked structurally but required refinement in:

- Layout spacing  
- Section separation  
- Responsiveness  

I iteratively adjusted the design by:

- Refining CSS styling  
- Improving visual hierarchy  
- Making navigation expandable for future assignments  

---

## Deployment Challenges

I encountered a 404 issue when enabling GitHub Pages. The root cause was:

- The repository was a private fork.  
- GitHub does not allow GitHub Pages for private forked repositories.  

### Resolution

- Created a new public repository  
- Reinitialized git  
- Enabled Pages using `main` branch / `root` deployment  

This clarified the distinction between:

- GitHub Actions automation  
- GitHub Pages publishing

# 🔹 Problem 2 – Pac-Man (Valentine’s Special 💘)

## Objective

Build a playable Pac-Man game including:

- Player movement  
- Wall collision detection  
- Pellet scoring  
- Ghost AI  
- Life system  
- Rose power-up  
- Heart projectile mechanic  

---

## Development Strategy

I decomposed the game into phases:

1. Grid-based movement  
2. Wall collision logic  
3. Pellet detection and scoring  
4. Ghost AI  
5. Life and reset system  
6. Rose power-up mechanic  
7. Projectile collision detection  

---

## Iterative Development

The most challenging parts were:

- Preventing wall pass-through  
- Ensuring grid alignment  
- Projectile collision detection  

AI-assisted debugging helped identify logic flaws in:

- Tile boundary checks  
- Movement step size  
- Ghost collision conditions  

---

## Key Lessons from Game Implementation

- Breaking logic into phases prevents cascading bugs.  
- Collision detection requires careful coordinate consistency.  
- Small modular additions are more stable than large rewrites.

# 🔹 Problem 3 – Data Scaffolding from the Internet  
## (Copilot CLI Agentic Programming)

This problem focused on building an automated arXiv feed system using GitHub Actions and Copilot CLI.

---

## System Architecture

The final system consists of:

```
arXiv API → Python fetch script → data.json → Static frontend → GitHub Actions automation
```

The frontend remains static, while data updates daily via CI.

---

## Copilot CLI Usage

For this problem, I explicitly used GitHub Copilot CLI to scaffold and refine components.

---

### Step 1 – Designing the Workflow

```bash
gh copilot suggest "Design an automated workflow for fetching arXiv papers daily and committing JSON updates"
```

This helped outline:

- Cron scheduling  
- Python execution  
- Conditional commit logic  

---

### Step 2 – Generating the Fetch Script

```bash
gh copilot suggest "Write a Python script that fetches the latest 5 arXiv papers and outputs structured JSON"
```

The initial script required iteration due to:

- URL encoding issues  
- Missing fields  
- Control character errors  

Follow-up refinement:

```bash
gh copilot suggest "Fix URL encoding issue in arXiv API query using urllib.parse"
```

This resolved the `InvalidURL` error.

---

### Step 3 – GitHub Actions Automation

```bash
gh copilot suggest "Create a GitHub Actions workflow that runs daily at midnight and commits updates only if data.json changes"
```

The generated YAML included:

- Cron schedule (`0 0 * * *`)  
- Python environment setup  
- Commit logic  

---

### Step 4 – Debugging CI Permissions (403 Error)

Error encountered:

```
Permission denied to github-actions[bot]
```

Prompt used:

```bash
gh copilot suggest "GitHub Actions push failed with 403 permission denied, how to fix?"
```

Resolution:

- Enabled **Read and write permissions** under Workflow permissions in repository settings.

---

### Step 5 – GitHub Pages 404

Issue:

- Repository fork could not publish Pages.

Resolution:

- Created independent public repository  
- Reinitialized git  
- Re-enabled Pages  

---

### Step 6 – Frontend Rendering

```bash
gh copilot suggest "Create JavaScript to fetch JSON and render arXiv papers dynamically in a card layout"
```

This generated the base rendering logic, which I then styled manually.

---

## What Worked Well

- Small, focused prompts  
- Using CLI for automation scaffolding  
- Explicit debugging prompts for CI failures  

---

## What Required Iteration

- arXiv URL encoding  
- GitHub Actions write permissions  
- Pages deployment from forked repo  
- Non-fast-forward git push conflicts  

---

# 🔹 Agentic Programming Reflection

Problem 3 demonstrated:

- The importance of decomposing systems into modular components  
- The value of iterative prompt refinement  
- The necessity of understanding platform-level constraints (permissions, forks, CI behavior)  

Copilot CLI was most effective when:

- Generating structured YAML workflows  
- Debugging CI failures  
- Proposing system-level architecture  

---

# 🔹 Final Outcome

The final system includes:

- A public GitHub Pages website  
- A playable Pac-Man game  
- An automatically updating arXiv feed  
- A scheduled CI workflow  
- Modular frontend and backend separation  

---

# 🔹 Conclusion

This homework provided hands-on experience in AI-assisted software engineering. While Problems 1 and 2 focused on iterative AI-guided development and debugging, Problem 3 emphasized agentic orchestration using Copilot CLI to scaffold, automate, and maintain a data pipeline.

The experience reinforced that effective AI use is not about one-shot code generation, but about iterative refinement, modular design, and structured problem decomposition.
